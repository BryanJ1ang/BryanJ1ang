### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Bryan. 

I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

Seeking out internships for 2024 Summer. Feel free to reach out by email at <Bryanjiang168@gmail.com>

Currently, I am working on my fullstack Chess project. Currently, have a playable game. Just working out some tweaks and likely, brainstorming 
any additional features to add to it. You can try it out [here](https://chess-c486876bf51a.herokuapp.com/) and see if you can beat my engine :)
