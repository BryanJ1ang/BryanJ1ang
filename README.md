### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Bryan. 

I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

Seeking out internships for 2024 Summer and/or Fall. Feel free to reach out by email at <Bryanjiang168@gmail.com>

Currently, I am working on my Chess project. I am building an AI Chess engine and once I am finished with that, I plan on using Springboot to deploy an online server.
