# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Bryan. 

I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

Currently seeking out internships for 2024 Winter and/or Summer. Feel free to reach out by email at <Bryanjiang168@gmail.com>

Below is a collection of my projects. Currently consisting of games just because Chess and card games were some of my favourite past-times while growing up.
