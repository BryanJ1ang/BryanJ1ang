# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Bryan. 

I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

Currently seeking out internships for 2024 Winter (January-April) and Summer (May-August) internships. Feel free to reach out on [linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-jiang-481477262) or by email at Bryanjiang168@gmail.com

Below is a collection of my projects. Currently consisting of games just because Chess and cardgames were some of my favourite past-times while growing up.
